# ESP-rogue-xork

A cooperative, multiplayer, procedurally-generated text-based adventure game run on esp32.

## TLDR

each esp32 runs its own game in a unique procedurally generated world. this world is one of a number of biomes -- forest, tundra, desert, etc -- and to beat the game the player bust first play throuhg and concour their own world. they will then gain access to the ability to connect with other players and play through their dungeons as well. clearing each biome yeilds keys which are gathered to beat the game. take heed, every player will have a unique world, with different items, enemies, and paths, meaning there is value in trading biomes with every player you encouunter.

## Note

This project is in it's infancy, EVERYTHING IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. I'm still waiting to order more eps32's to properly test project properly.

## How to Play

1. beat your world.
2. swap worlds with other players.
3. beat one of every biome.
4. memorialize your victory.
